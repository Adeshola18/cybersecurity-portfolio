I am an entry-level cybersecurity enthusiast focused on Security Operations Center (SOC) fundamentals, including threat detection, log analysis, and incident reporting. 
My background in Applied Chemistry and customer service has strengthened my analytical thinking and communication skills. 
After successfully earning my CC certification from ISC2, I am studying with ALX to learn more in the Cyber Security field.
I am also currently preparing for the CompTIA A+ certification and building hands-on experience using tools such as Wireshark, Nmap, and SIEM platforms through structured labs and simulations.
